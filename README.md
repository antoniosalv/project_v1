Background Information and Motivation

The motivation of this project is to explore certain health factors such as obesity, physical activity and nutrition along with health policies and favorable environment at the state level. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than a third of US adults are obese. Obesity is one of the main factors of preventable chronic diseases and healthcare costs in the US. Current estimates ranges from $147 billion to nearly $210 billion per year. The Center for Medicare and Medical Services (CMS) projected that healthcare spending will grow at a 5.5% annually through 2026 and will account for almost 20% of the  US economy. According to Big Cities Health Coalition, obesity is linked to a higher rates of chronic diseases such as heart diseases, diabetes, some cancers, arthritis and poor mental health. Obesity is the second leading preventable cause of death in the US. 

In 2010 the US federal government announce the prevention and treatment of obesity as important part of its campaign to improve health of Americans. Since then several initiatives and programs have been implemented in order to revert the increasing trend in obesity that has doubled in the last 40 years. These initiatives and programs range from nutritional education, food labeling through specific funding to improve the food system at local, state and federal level. The Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity (DNPAO) under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is one of the main federal entities at forefront of decreasing obesity among US population.
